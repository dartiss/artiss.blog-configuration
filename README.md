# Artiss.blog Configuration

This is a WordPress plugin, used on the site artiss.blog to add site-specific (but not theme-specific) additional features.

It's all GPL so feel free to borrow, fork, etc, any component of it. Don't expect coding nirvana - I've written this for just my own site and not for public consumption so comments, coding standards, etc, may not apply. As it's not an official plugin, no translation is available, so I don't bother with text domains, etc.

## Changelog

**Version 4.7**
* Removed translation code
* Added a full header, inc. GPL details

**Version 4.6**

* Further code quality improvements
* Removed some unused functions and merged others

**Version 4.5**

* Improved code quality
* Added Amazon disclosure message
